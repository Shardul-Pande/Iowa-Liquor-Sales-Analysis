# Iowa-Liquor-Sales-Analysis


Iowa Liquor Sales Analysis Project Summary:

In this project, we undertook a comprehensive analysis of Iowa liquor sales encompassing data profiling, staging, dimensional modeling, and data cleansing. Leveraging tools like Alteryx and Talend, we efficiently processed diverse datasets from various sources, including the Iowa Liquor Sales dataset and associated files. Data profiling was performed to understand the structure and quality of the data, guiding subsequent data cleaning tasks.

We loaded the cleaned and staged data into separate staging tables using Alteryx and Talend, optimizing the data for analysis. A dimensional model was created to facilitate in-depth querying and insights into Iowa liquor sales, considering dimensions like store, county, city, category, item, and vendor. Additionally, we addressed data inconsistencies, ensuring accurate representation in the model.

Furthermore, we addressed complex business questions related to liquor sales, such as sales metrics, sales over time, and sales by various dimensions. Integration schema and SQL queries were utilized to answer these questions. Finally, we visualized the results using Power BI and Tableau, providing actionable insights and facilitating data-driven decision-making.

This project showcases proficiency in data analysis, ETL processes, dimensional modeling, data cleansing, and visualization to derive meaningful insights from Iowa liquor sales data, enabling informed decision-making within the domain.
